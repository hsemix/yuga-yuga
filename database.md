# Database

## Introduction

Yuga makes interacting with databases extremely simple across a variety of database backends using either raw SQL, the [fluent query builder](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/queries), and the [Elegant ORM](https://yuga-framework.gitbook.io/documentation/database#elegant). Currently, Yuga supports three databases:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
