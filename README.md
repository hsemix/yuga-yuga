# Yuga Framework

To get started you just need one command `composer create-project yuga/yuga your-project-folder -s dev`



**Local Development Server**

If you have PHP installed locally and you would like to use PHP's built-in development server to launch your application, you may use the `start` Yuga command. This command will start a development server at `http://localhost:8000`:

```bash
php yuga start
```
