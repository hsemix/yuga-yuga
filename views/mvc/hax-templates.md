# Hax Templates

 Hax is a simple, yet powerful template engine that comes with yuga. Unlike most of the PHP template engines, Hax does not restrict you from using plain PHP code in your views. Actually, all Hax views are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are edited, this means Hax adds basically no overhead to your application. Hax view files use the `.hax.php` file extension and are typically stored in the `resources/views` directory inside of the main directory of your main application.
